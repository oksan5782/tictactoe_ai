Tictactoe Terminal game against AI with Alpha-beta pruning optimization


Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation with an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. This Python console application allows you to play against an intelligent AI that strives to make optimal moves.



## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

3. Choose your symbol:

    - Enter 'X' if you want to play as 'X'.
    - Enter 'O' if you want to play as 'O'.

4. Make your move:

    - When it's your turn, enter the cell (0-8) where you want to place your symbol.

5. Enjoy the game:

    - The AI will make its moves using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

## Implementation Details

The application is implemented in Python and uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the optimal moves for the AI opponent.
